#The Essentials:#

	Whether Hardware or Software, these are some essential tools for project building, teamwork and productivity.##
		[Github][1]
			* Version control lets all group members change code from various parts of the project and upload their version. Others can then easily clone the most recent version and everyone will be working on the most recent version of the project. The best thing? You can revert to an older version if anything goes wrong. 
			* Note: Don't delete anything off your Github post Hackathon because Employers like to see your Github (and that you use it!)
			* Youtuve, Udacity and Udemy are all great places to get started with Git and Github
		[Devpost][2]
			* Many Hackathons use Devpost in order to accept submissions from the hackers. It is a good idea to have one set up before you go to a Hackathon because it saves time. Just like with Github, make sure your work is on your Devpost for future Employers.

##Using Hardware?##

	Here are some common hardware to hack with and software choices:
		
		Raspberry Pi
			* This super small computer has gained attention very quickly because it elegantly encapsulates software with hardware in a way that creates endless possibilities for hacking. 
			* Python comes loaded into the OS Raspbian, so make sure you can also use Python on your laptop (download Python and IDLE).
			* Check out the Raspberry Pi FAQs to find answers to specific questions if you know your what your prepared hack is/want to use something other than Python. [FAQS][3]
		Oculus Rift
			* Hack for virtual reality with the Oculus. Many Hackathons let you rent them out in their hardware labs so take the opportunity to play with one of the newest tech toys around (it's a little pricey to buy outright).
			* There is awesome support for developing for Oculus using Unity 3D. Also check out Unreal Game Engine. Terrain builders are your saviour and so are youtube tutorials.
		Google Cardboard
			* The less pricey version of the Oculus rift. It works with your phone to deliver a great virtual reality simulation. Just takes some cardboard, some lenses and a magnet! 
			* The Google Cardboard API for Unity 3D is easy to use and integrate. Android Studio is also a must since Google Cardboard is run off your mobile device. 
			* Note: it is a battery drainer. Do NOT, I repeat NOT, forget a charger!
		Myo
			* The Myo band tracks movement which can make for some really responsive hacks. 
			* The Myo runs Lua, a simple scripting language that is mainly for applications. Give the documentation a read-over if you’re considering this to make sure you want to work with Lua.

##Strictly Software?##

	Here are some of our favorites and what they are great for:
		
		Android Studio
			* An Essential for App development on Android Devices. Downloading this is not an easy process and if you download it before the hackathon it will save you much needed time! It uses Java so make sure you have Java downloaded on your computer as well.
		Sublime Text Editor
			* Among one of the best text editors (get the free trial version!) because of its flexibility and simplicity as well as elegant dark theme. The syntax can be changed to many different coding languages for you to use in your project. Although the free version will keep bugging you to get a license, it won’t actually make you purchase a license.
